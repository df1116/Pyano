DESCRIPTION OF THIS PART OF THE SERIES
---------------------------------------

This part of the classical music symbols series currently includes 13 black dotted note music symbols in several formats with print formats and scalable vector formats in mind: 

* Sharp sign
* Flat sign
* Natural sign
* Double-sharp sign
* Double-flat sign
* Double-natural sign
* Two compound signs (Natural-sharp sign, Natural-flat sign) 

These accidentals are part of the series of Printable, Scalable Vector Black Music Notation Symbols. All carefully crafted music notation symbols in this series are proportional to each other upon delivery to meet the standards of music professionals who know the difference and for anyone who appreciates high quality music images.

All music symbols in this series are proportional to each other. Two EPS vector formats are provided, which allows scalability (resizing) without loss of quality, unlike typical Web image formats (GIF, JPG, PNG).

In addition, two EPS vector formats allow scalability (resizing) without loss of quality, unlike typical Web image formats (GIF, JPG, PNG). If you wish to resize them and maintain these proportions, just resize each music symbol image by the same amount.

Need treble clefs, bass clefs, alto clefs, individual whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, eighth notes, sixteenth notes, beamed notes, and more? You'll find all these and more within this series at http://linkwaregraphics.com/music/symbols/

FORMATS
----------------
This music images series was created with print formats and scalable vector formats in mind - printable music images and vector formats for easy scalability without any image quality loss. Two vector formats are provided to be compatible with Adobe Illustrator CS3 and older versions, Adobe Fireworks CS3 and older versions, CorelDRAW, and other vector graphics software. 


2 EPS Vector formats, all with transparency: 

1. Adobe Illustrator CS3 compatibility
2. Legacy Adobe Illustrator 8 compatibility


JPG: 
Saved at 100% Quality with ICC profile included. This version has a white background since JPG format does not support transparency.

PNG:
Saved as PNG-24 with transparency

Note that some other graphics software will import EPS files, such as Adobe Photoshop, but the import will lose the vector scalability and other features.

------------------------
PRINTING
------------------------
- The treble clef music symbol within this series is currently sized to fill a standard U.S. letter-size sheet of paper ("Portrait" layout mode) with a 1" or more margin. 
- Except where noted, all music symbols will print with Portrait layout in mind. An exception is within this set - the double-accidentals and compound signs use Landscape mode. 
- Each music image file has its own unique crop marks as well and is centered within the screen and page. 
- Since these symbols are proportional to each other, the other symbols in this series will not necessarily fill an entire standard US letter-sized page.
- You'll probably get the best quality, most professional results from the EPS format, although all formats provided should print well as delivered within the zip file.

IMPORTANT NOTE: 

Unlike other music symbols in this series that are each provided as individual, separate image files, the 8 accidentals are provided within 2 files - the sharp, flat, and natural symbols are in one file (separate layers for EPS versions), and the double-accidentals and compound signs are in the other file (also separate layers for EPS versions).

-------------------------
WEB USE
-------------------------
Since this series is created and optimized for high quality print and scalable vector formats, NONE of these images are optimized for Web use, but it's a simple matter to optimize them for Web use if desired. For the best results, use the EPS versions to scale the size to your needs (without any quality loss), then optimize the file size and save for the Web in GIF or PNG format.

Note that the JPG and PNG versions in this series are large file sizes created for print and thus not recommended for Web use without optimizing them and using the appropriate format.

To optimize these for the Web:

* Use the EPS versions to scale the image(s) without quality loss to the size needed and save to GIF (with or without transparency) or PNG-8 format (without transparency).
    
* If you need transparency for your Web images, transparent GIF format is supported by the most browsers at this point, although the latest versions of the most common browsers now support transparent PNG (Firefox 2+, Internet Explorer 7+, for example). So, for now the easiest format to use for the most browsers to see your transparent images as you intend is still transparent GIF. See PNG-supporting Browsers for more information:
